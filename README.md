# Stack Data Structure in Java

This repository contains implementations of the Stack data structure in Java, including both Fixed Array Stack and Dynamic Stack. These implementations are equipped with proper exception handling mechanisms, such as Stack Empty and Stack Overflow, to ensure robustness in various use cases.

## Project Overview ðŸ“š

As part of my journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, I have implemented the Stack data structure. This implementation includes both fixed-capacity stacks and dynamic-capacity stacks, designed to handle scenarios where the stack grows or shrinks. I followed best practices, such as exception handling, to ensure the code is reliable and easy to use.

The concepts were learned through YouTube tutorials and applied using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Fixed Array Stack
- **Description:** A stack implementation with a fixed size. Once the stack reaches its capacity, no more elements can be pushed onto the stack.
- **Exception Handling:** Proper handling for Stack Overflow and Stack Empty exceptions.

### Dynamic Stack
- **Description:** A stack implementation that dynamically adjusts its size based on the elements being pushed or popped. When the stack is full, it doubles its capacity, and when it's mostly empty, it shrinks to save space.
- **Exception Handling:** Proper handling for Stack Overflow and Stack Empty exceptions.

## Get Started ðŸš€

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository and open the desired stack implementation file in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA). No additional setup is required!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jawwadkhan777/Stack-Data-Structure.git
```
